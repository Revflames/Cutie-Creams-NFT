## Cutie Creams Community Building & Release | Q2 2022
Our focus for Q1 going into Q2 is to promote the Cutie Creams to the NFT space by informing new members about our community benefits and its goals for the future. Discord will stay private for the majority of this quarter with limited invite acceptance links being sent out on Twitter. This will give us a steady flow of interested members and allow us to focus on member individuality so we can get to know each and every single one of you!

This is a large first step for the project and we are focused on making sure it gets done right. We will also be working on implementing security measures by completing a discord security audit and as well as a smart contract security audit. Here is a brief list of things that will be accomplished this quarter.

* Discord Deployment & Community Whitelist
* Implementation of Community Suggestions
* Cutie Creams NFT Contract Deployment
* Minting Website & NFT Giveaways
* Community Wallet Funding & Giveback Programs
* Special Cuties Membership Benefits

## NFT Airdrops & Collaboration Efforts | Q3 2022
Continuing from the second quarter will be our introduction of additional NFTs to holders of the original collection. A snapshot of holders will be conducted (Date TBA) and those who hold Cuties will get a 1 to 1 airdrop of an additional sweet that will be announced in the future! That does not stop there as we will also be giving back to the community by providing a percentage of the minting earnings and OpenSea sales into the community wallet for giveaways (paid out in ETH).

Funds will be distributed out via a percentage distribution by allocating the majority of the funds to those who are verified cuties owner. Overall prizes will be larger to those who own a Cutie Cream. This will be our time to take into consideration of additional community suggestions as well. Here is a brief list of things that will be accomplished this quarter.

* Design and Development of a Hidden Sweet!
* Additional Community Suggestions Implementations
* Additional Community Activities & Content
* Large Donation to a Good Cause
* Collaboration Efforts with Likeminded Communities
* Community Giveaways Deployment

## Cuties Branding & Animated Series | Q4 2022
By this quarter of the year we will be focused on getting the whole wide world to know who we are as a community, We will start working with a company that will be providing us apparel, accessories, and other awesome stuff for our community to buy and show off to the world.

The scoop does not stop there, as with all our earnings we will be putting a portion of the earning towards our community members in more exciting ways you can't possibly imagine. We will also be creating a animated series of episodes of our Cutie Creams that will be in continuous development until the end of the year. We will be looking for talented animators to add your Cuties into them so we can build up our story together. Here is a brief list of things that will be accomplished this quarter.

* Start Development on An Animated Series
* Branding Focus For Our Cuties Members
* Continuous Implementation of Community Suggestions

## Cuties Metaverse & Beyond | 2023
As the project develops we want to create a decentralized application that will serve as a metaverse for our Cutie Creams and all the sweets that get included into it! This is well ahead in time but as the project progresses we will keep everyone informed on plans for the next year.

* Build a Diverse Metaverse World For Our Cuties
